        <div class="content">People use their Android smartphones for a varied range of tasks, one of which is glancing at the information. People consume a lot of short information in the form of weather report, news headlines, text messages, etc. While there are separate channels that provide brief as well as detailed information based on different categories, there is no good way to quickly glance through all the information one wants in a single place. How can the experience of glance on Android smartphones be improved?</div>

        <div class="title-small easyglance-colour">Paper prototypes</div>
        <div class="content">It is always good to begin with low fidelity prototypes. Paper prototypes are easy to make, and work perfectly for the initial phase. These can be tested with a group of people, and allow instant changes and revisions. Since the features of the app, along with its structure and layout, are quite flexible in the beginning, paper prototypes were my go-to-option.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content">Since users would want to get to the information and actions they need quickly, why not present them with these options directly when they see their phones? This is when I thought that the lock-screen of the phone would be the optimal screen to present the information that the user needs, since the lock-screen is the first that any user sees.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content"><b>Paper prototype #1</b></div>
        <div class="content">This prototype was inspired by the Google Assistant Feed, which presents stuff like weather, meetings, etc. in the form of detailed cards. Large cards on the lock-screen would not be a nice first-view of the phone. Thus, a left swipe on the lock-screen to slide in the EasyGlance feed from the right edge would be a decent option. Additionally, I wanted it to be handy for the users to customise their EasyGlance feed right there. Hence, the presence of the edit button right there in the top right.</div>
        <img src="images/easyglance-paper-prototype-1.jpeg" class="full-image">
        <div class="image-caption">Paper prototype #1</div>
        <br>
        <div class="content"><b>Paper prototype #2</b></div>
        <div class="content">This prototype was inspired by the very nature of notifications. Notifications arrive on the phone and are displayed on the lock-screen when there is something important to notify. Once the user no longer needs a notification, it can be swiped away. Why not give the information that the user needs in the form of notifications on the lock-screen? The EasyGlance notifications could be expanded to get the information, and could be swiped away if not required.</div>

        <div class="content">My peers in the course evaluated the paper prototypes based on Nielsen's heuristics, and flagged the violations with appropriate description. The severity rating assigned to each heuristic violation helped me in prioritising the critical issues. Based on the heuristic evaluation, I was able to find issues in my paper prototypes, and I fixed the critical ones as I started designing the high fidelity prototype.</div>

        <div class="title-small easyglance-colour">High fidelity prototype</div>
        <div class="content">I decided to transform paper prototype #2 into high fidelity because users are more familiar with notifications. In the design of high fidelity prototype, I paid attention to minute details such as layout, icons, typography and colour. Each screen of the application was wireframed, and then converted to a fully refined page. This was the point where I actually made decisions about the look and feel.</div>

        <div class="content">After the completion of the high fidelity prototype, I conducted an in-person experiment with a group of people to find if the app had any usability issues. With a formal testing protocol, the participants were asked to perform a simple task using the prototype, and their actions were closely observed. I also interviewed the participants in the end, to understand their experience.</div>

        <div class="title-small easyglance-colour">A/B test</div>
        <div class="content">After conducting the in-person experiment, I realised that my design wasn't perfect. Based on the observations and discussions with the participants of the in-person experiment, I made some changes and came up with two designs. A simple online A/B test was hosted on usertesting.com with 4 participants. 3 out 4 participants were able to successfully complete the task, with version A getting a better success rate than version B. Their recorded videos were received, which included their verbal reactions to the task they were performing. By analysing these videos and listening to the participant feedback, I decided to go ahead with version A and improved it with minor modifications.</div>
