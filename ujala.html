            <div class="content-section-heading">Crowdsourcing</div>
            <div class="content-section-text">Based on the analysis of charging patterns, we concluded that different people charge their phones at different times. Interestingly, there is a significantly high chance that at least a few mobile devices are getting charged in a given area at any point of time. Hence, we could crowdsource this data because charging devices would indicate the presence of power supply.</div>

            <div class="content-section-heading">Running the app in background</div>
            <div class="content-section-text">To get real-time crowdsourced data, developing the app to run in background was crucial. Ideally, people would open the app only when they need to know which part of the campus has power. But, we need to gather data all the time, and hence the app must run in background to monitor the charging state of mobile.</div>

            <div class="content-section-heading">The map view</div>
            <div class="content-section-text">Since the app is based on the concept of crowdsourcing, we wanted as many people to use it as possible, because more users would mean more data points, resulting in much more reliable information. Displaying the information in a useful and visually appealing manner would encourage users to keep using the app. So we decided to show pointers that indicate the presence of power supply on a map view, which would make it easier for people to understand.</div>

            <div class="content-section-text">After the development of the first version of the app, we conducted an intensive testing of the app with real users and received feedback from around 50 on-campus residents. Though the feedback regarding the functionality and usefulness of the app was positive, we also discovered that user experience was not as per the expectations.</div>
